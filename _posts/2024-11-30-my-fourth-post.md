<h2>Reaching an Important Milestone</h2>

<p>I want to share something exciting: I just made my first $1,000 from online music production lessons! This is a big deal for me, especially since my highest earnings from an album featuring my production were only $40. The best part though? I did it without the long grind associated with making and selling lengthy video courses.</p>

<p> As someone with a background in video and audio editing, I know how much work goes into creating a course. Imagine filming 10 hours of video, then editing it down to a 5-hour course that sells for $45 (or $19.99 on Udemy, which ends up being around $12 after the platform takes its cut). After years of doing this type of work, I wanted to take a different approach—one that felt easier, less mentally exhausting, and more affordable to produce.</p>

<p> I've been offering my services on Fiverr for the past nine years, mainly focusing on audio production like mixing, mastering, podcasts, audiobooks, sound effects, video editing, ad creation, and creative writing. Eventually, I moved into consulting for business owners in podcasting and audio production, which I really enjoy. Honestly, it has worked out even better than I expected. From the start, I had a unique challenge: I wanted to teach a course using my favorite device. If you've read my last blog, you might already know a bit about it.</p>

<h2>How I Promote and Sell My Freestyle'd Maschine Music Production Course</h2>

<p>I update my Fiverr profile every few months. If you're not familiar with Fiverr, think of my profile as a landing page that brings in potential students. I've kept all the content short and simple, using the AIDA framework (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) to attract people. I share a few key pieces of content, like a 60-second teaser video, a remix of a popular rap song (to show my production skills), and an electronic R&B cover to highlight my versatility.</p>

<p>I made sure my gig thumbnail has a centered headshot generated by DALLE in a hand-drawn style. People are naturally drawn to human faces, so—with the help of AI—I used that same attention-grabbing effect as a selfie, without actually taking a selfie. This is enough to get people's attention and make them feel confident they're working with an expert they can trust. I also optimize everything for SEO so the right students—beginners or new users of the device who need real, hands-on help—can easily find me.</p>

<h2>AMA-Style Zoom Meetings vs. The YouTube Academy Approach</h2>

<p> Creating a detailed, pre-scripted course always felt overwhelming and time-consuming. So, when I launched this course, I chose to offer AMA-style consultations at $90 an hour ($75 after Fiverr's 20% cut). When I launched the gig, I knew I needed just one sale to prove my skills, so the video you see on my gig page is actually a 60-second clip from my first client's session. No editing—no stress! These sessions are fully personalized and focus on what the student needs right then. By using this MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach, I've avoided endless hours of scripting and editing, which keeps me energized and ready to deliver great lessons. These days, I'm careful about avoiding burnout, and this approach has been so much more rewarding. </p> 

<p>To help new students, I created a Maschine session puzzle with a solution video to introduce them to my teaching style. The link to the video is unlisted on YouTube, visible only to students after they purchase, as optional pre-course material. This way, students can get hands-on with the device without having to read the manual or go through every button before we meet.</p>

<p>All Fiverr gigs have a requirements section, so I turned this into an onboarding form with a few well-thought-out questions. Even though each lesson is an hour, I set the delivery time to 14 days—giving plenty of time for rescheduling across time zones. This onboarding form also allows me to collect emails for future promotions and gather data to improve my ideal student profile. Honestly, the best part of all this is that it feels like what I used to do as a teenager—working with someone to solve problems and create something cool.</p>

<p>When someone reaches out, I have a simple 1-2-3 approach: I ask two pre-qualifying questions (Are you a PC or Mac user? How long have you been producing?) and then make a standard offer. My current conversion rate is 4%—which might not sound like much, but according to recent analytics, I'm doing better than 77% of other sellers in my subcategory.</p>


<h3>Why This Approach Works</h3>

<p>This approach might not be for everyone, but for me, it's been both flexible and effective. With Fiverr, I'm able to turn leads into real conversations and create content from these sessions that I can use for future promotions. Using a platform like Fiverr to host my course works well for me, helping me connect with students I wouldn't have met otherwise. By applying what I've learned about copywriting and SEO, I've been able to find students who are truly on the same wavelength. A lot of people say you should start a YouTube channel and build a following, but sometimes taking a different approach can be more effective—and get you to "the bag" quicker.</p>

<h3>Words to the Wise</h3>

<p>If you're thinking about selling your expertise online, I recommend giving this approach a shot—whether on Fiverr or another platform. I often meet people who want to start selling courses or making podcasts or other recordings but get overwhelmed or fall into debt before they even launch. Sometimes, all you need is a well-crafted landing page and the willingness to dive in. If you're curious enough, you can create something really rewarding.</p>
