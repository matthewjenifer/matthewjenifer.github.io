    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This repository contains a personal blog documenting my journey from content producer to software engineer. The blog will feature updates on my music theory app, Groove Theory, as well as reflections on my prior years in freelance audio production and other creative entrepreneurial efforts.

        As a Jr Dev, this blog shall also serve to showcase my technical skills in static website building using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. The blog should demonstrate my ability to create clean and organized code, use version control, and optimize for search engines. It also showcases my writing skills, attention to detail, and passion for education, audio, and technology.</p>
