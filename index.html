    <p>In effort to document my journey from content producer to software engineer, this blog will feature updates on my music theory app - Groove Theory - as well as reflections on prior years in freelance audio production and other lessons learned in my creative entrepreneurial efforts.</p>
    <h2>Thank you for visiting.</h2>
     <p>As a Jr Dev, this blog shall also serve to showcase my technical skills in static website building using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. The blog should demonstrate my ability to create clean and organized code, use version control, and optimize for search engines. It also showcases my writing skills, attention to detail, and passion for education, audio, and technology.</p>
